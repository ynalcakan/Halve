# About

I'm a computer engineer who currently working as a Research Assistant at [Altınbaş University](http://www.altinbas.edu.tr/) in Istanbul.
My work interests: AI, ML, abductive logic programming(ALP), natural language programming(NLP)
and data visualization. 
  
About personal info,
I love reading about psychology, sociology, neuroscience, philosophy.
As you can understand, [GEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) is like a holly book for me!
And I've a new hobby in these days "analog photography". It's like looking this milenium world
in a [vintage view](http://www.flickr.com/106092908@N08). Also I'm adding my MSc presentations(Turkish) to that Google Drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx_6kuYBoaAealJhcTVsV3Q4V1E?usp=sharing).
> “To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair.
> The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed.
> The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
> The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.
> And the power they took from the people will return to the people.
> And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.
> Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men.
> Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
> You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
> You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful.
> To make this life a wonderful adventure.
> Let us use that power!
> Let us all unite!.” 
> ― Charlie Chaplin - From the movie The Great Dictator
