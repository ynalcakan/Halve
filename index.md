About personal info,
I love reading about psychology, sociology, neuroscience, philosophy.
As you can understand, [GEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) is like a holly book for me!
I've a new hobby in these times "analog photography". It's like looking this milenium world
in a [vintage view](http://www.flickr.com/106092908@N08).
